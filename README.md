# Airdrop & Signatures in Solidity

Welcome to my exploration of advanced Solidity techniques focused on Merkle Airdrops and Cryptographic Signatures.

## What's Inside?

- **Merkle Airdrops**: 
  - Efficient token distribution using Merkle Proofs.
  - Techniques for gas optimization and scalability.

- **EIP-712 Signatures**:
  - Secure off-chain transaction authorization.
  - Implementations to prevent replay attacks.

## Foundry Integration

- Scripts for setting up and deploying contracts.
- Testing strategies tailored for these complex scenarios.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash 
git clone [your-repo-url]
```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
- Ensure you have Foundry installed. 
- Run `forge install` for any additional dependencies.

3. **Explore & Learn**:
- Dive into the code, experiment with the contracts.
- Run tests with `forge test` to see implementations in action.

4. To get an input run the GenerateInput.s.sol using ```forge script script/GenerateInput.s.sol:GenerateInput```

5. To get an output run the MakeMerkle.s.sol using ```forge script script/MakeMerkle.s.sol:MakeMerkle```
